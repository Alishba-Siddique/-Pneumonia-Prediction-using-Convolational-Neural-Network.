# Pneumonia-Prediction-using-Convolational-Neural-Network.
A Jupyter notebook for Pneumonia prediction using Convolutional Neural Network from X-rays images.

The images trained, tested and validated for the neural network are chest X-Ray images. The implementation of clinical-decision support algorithms for medical imaging faces challenges with reliability and interpretability. Here, I establish a diagnostic tool based on a deep-learning framework for the screening of patients with common treatable blinding retinal diseases.

The normal chest X-ray depicts clear lungs without any areas of abnormal opacification in the image.
Bacterial pneumonia typically exhibits a focal lobar consolidation around upper lobes (white arrows)
Viral pneumonia manifests with a more diffuse ‘‘interstitial’’ pattern in both lungs.
